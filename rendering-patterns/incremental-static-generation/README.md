# Incremental Static Generation

**The Incremental Static Generation (iSSG)** pattern was introduced as an upgrade to SSG, to help solve the dynamic data problem and help static sites scale for large amounts of frequently changing data. 

<br>

## iSSG - Sample Code
iSSG works on two fronts to incrementally introduce updates to an existing static site after it has been built.
1. Allows addition of new pages
2. Allows updates to existing pages also known as Incremental Static "Re"generation

The lazy loading concept is used to include new pages on the website after the build. This means that the new page is generated immediately on the first request. While the generation takes place, a fallback page or a loading indicator can be shown to the user on the front-end.

- ### Adding New pages  
The lazy loading concept is used to include new pages on the website after the build. This means that the new page is generated immediately on the first request. While the generation takes place, a fallback page or a loading indicator can be shown to the user on the front-end

```js
// In getStaticPaths(), you need to return the list of
// ids of product pages (/products/[id]) that youâ€™d
// like to pre-render at build time. To do so,
// you can fetch all products from a database.
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const products = await getProductsFromDatabase();

  const paths = products.map((product) => ({
     params: { id: product.id }
  }));


  // fallback: true means that the missing pages
  // will not 404, and instead can render a fallback.
  return { paths, fallback: true };
}

// params will contain the id for each generated page.
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  return {
    props: {
      product: await getProductFromDatabase(params.id)
    }
  }
}


export default function Product({ product }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  if (router.isFallback) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  // Render product
}
```
Here, we have used fallback: true. Now if the page corresponding to a specific product is unavailable, we show a fallback version of the page.


- ### Update Existing pages
To re-render an existing page, a suitable timeout is defined for the page. This will ensure that the page is revalidated whenever the defined timeout period has elapsed.

Thus, iSSG uses the stale-while-revalidate strategy where the user receives the cached or stale version while the revalidation takes place. The revalidation takes place completely in the background without the need for a full rebuild.

```js
// This function runs at build time on the build server
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      products: await getProductsFromDatabase(),
      revalidate: 60, // This will force the page to revalidate after 60 seconds
    }
  }
}

// The page component receives products prop from getStaticProps at build time
export default function Products({ products }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <ul>
        {products.map((product) => (
          <li key={product.id}>{product.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```
The code to revalidate the page after 60 seconds is included in the getStaticProps() function. When a request comes in the available static page is served first.

## iSSG Advantages

1. **Dynamic data**: The first advantage is obviously why iSSG was envisioned. Its ability to support dynamic data without a need to rebuild the site.
2. **Speed**: iSSG is at least as fast as SSG because data retrieval and rendering still takes place in the background. There is little processing required on the client or the server.
3. **Availability**: A fairly recent version of any page will always be available online for users to access. Even if the regeneration fails in the background, the old version remains unaltered.
4. **Consistent**: As the regeneration takes place on the server one page at a time, the load on the database and the backend is low and performance is consistent. As a result, there are no spikes in latency.
5. **Ease of Distribution**: Just like SSG sites, iSSG sites can also be distributed through a network of CDN's used to serve pre-rendered web pages.
